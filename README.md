- 👋 Hi, I’m @rubyavelar
- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning my career into the field of technology, particularly in Fullstack development. I also have a passion for gaming and geek culture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and honing my skills in Fullstack development through the Programa Desenvolve by Grupo Boticário in partnership with Alura.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative and challenging projects that allow me to apply my knowledge and contribute to the tech community.
- 📫 You can find me through my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/r%C3%BAbia-avelar-3345935a/">LinkedIn</a> or via <a href=mailto:rhs.avelar@gmail.com>e-mail</a>.

I’ve been learning Fullstack development since January 2023 and I acknowledge that I still have a long way to go to further develop my tech skills. However, I'm dedicated to giving my best and continuously improving.

Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to connect, collaborate, or discuss any exciting opportunities in the tech industry!
